Create resizable widgets to group links and design your new tab. A powerful, private and visual way to organize your shortcuts.

Say goodbye to scattered bookmarks and the bland default new tab. Say hello to Lynq—a beautiful, powerful, and completely private new tab experience designed to put you in control of your digital world.

Lynq transforms your browser's starting page into a fully customizable dashboard. Think of it as a smart home for your links, where everything you need is exactly where you want it to be. Whether you're a student managing research, a professional juggling projects, or just someone who loves an organized space, Lynq is built for you. Key Features:

Build Your Dashboard with Widgets: Create "Widget Links" for any topic you can imagine—work projects, daily news, social media, shopping lists, or creative inspiration. There's no limit!

Deep Customization: Give every widget a unique title and choose the perfect icon from a extensive library to make your dashboard visually intuitive and uniquely yours.

Powerful Link Grouping: Why have one link when you can have many? A single widget can hold multiple links, each with its own custom title and icon. It's the perfect way to group related resources and declutter your workspace.

Your Layout, Your Rules: Our flexible canvas is your playground. Effortlessly drag, drop, and resize your widgets to create a layout that’s perfectly tailored to your workflow and screen size.

100% Private & Local: Your privacy is our priority. Lynq runs entirely in your browser. There are no accounts to create, no logins to remember, and no data ever sent to a server. Your dashboard is yours and yours alone.

Easy Backup & Restore: Your setup is valuable. With a single click, you can export a full backup of your widgets and links. Moving to a new computer? Just import the file, and your personalized dashboard is instantly restored.
